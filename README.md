## Project

I am building a fitness tracker. This will primarily serve as a personal
tool but other people are certainly welcome to use it as well. For years
I brought a pen and notepad to the gym to track my weight lifting progress.
Then I smartened up and started using excel to track my progress.
I have years of data, it's not very clean, or efficient but it beats a pen and paper. Excel has a lot of functionality that I don't need and the app is cluttered and unpleasant to use.
So I'm creating an app that would essentially act
as a tool for me to track the weight I lift from week to week using my current
routine. Other users could sign up and make add their own exercises and to track their exercise data as well.

## Write between 3-5 user stories
As a user, I want to sign up, so that I can sign-in.
As a user, I want to sign in, so I can use the app.
As a user, I want to sign in, so I can save exercises.
As a user, I want to sign in, so I can save weight performed on exercises.
As a user, I want to save exercises, so that I have a record of when I performed certain exercises.
As a user, I want to save the weight I used, so that I can keep track of how much weight I'm lifting for each exercise.
As a user, I want to see my prior workouts and weight used, so I can keep an eye on my progress

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

## Routing
API-
Create exercise: POST; route: /exercise
A user creates an exercise and this triggers a POST request to save the exercise to the DB

Update exercise weight: PATCH; route: exercise/:id
A user enters a new date/weight for any exercise listed in exercise history. This triggers a POST request to create a new record of the weight and updates the DB.

Show exercise history: GET; route: exercise/
A user clicks the 'show exercise history’ button and this triggers a GET request to index all of the exercises stored in the DB

Delete exercise: DELETE
A user clicks the ‘delete’ button and this triggers a DELETE request and destroys the record stored in the DB.


## 3rd Party APIs

For now I'm keeping it simple. Could integrate with myFitnessPal for nutritional data or youtube for videos on form.

## Wireframes

## Timetable

Two repos one from browser template and one from rails template
Authentication stuff from tic-tac-toe to browser-template
Spin up local grunt server and spin up local rails server
Set up html skeleton to test user auth actions (sign-up etc)
Create resource new table with rails migration, bin/rails generate scaffold author given_name:string family_name:string (user:references)
In model add relationship, test each entity table with CURL resquests utilizing each CRUD
action. Then build out front-end.

day 1, 2: api
day 3, 4, 5: api/front end
day 6: clean up UI

## Check list
Check list:
*  Think about what kind of data your front-end will need from your back-end, and how that data will be used. Create an ERD.
*  Create two repos that your project will use, and add READMEs to both.
*  Create a simple front-end with HTML and CSS based (loosely) on your wireframes.
*  User our rails-api-template for your back-end. It already includes authentication.
*  After you have an ERD, check with a consultant to ensure your data model is appropriate for your goals. Then, build the models and migrations to represent this data. Test your models using the Rails console, and test your API endpoints using curl.
*  Before working on the front-end application, ensure all back-end endpoints work as expected. Knowing the back-end well will help you diagnose bugs on the front-end.
*  Write your front-end application using JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX.
*  Test, commit, and deploy often! Test, commit, deploy! Test your deployments!
*  When main features are finished, begin working on stretch goals and icebox features.
*  Finish your documentation. Make it high-quality.
